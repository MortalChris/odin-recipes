                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                     Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, 
                     stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li> 
                <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth,
                     about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring
                     until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture
                      and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated</li>
